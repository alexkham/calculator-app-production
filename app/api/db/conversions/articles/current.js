    abampere: `
  # Abampere&nbsp;
  
  The abampere, also known as the biot, is the electromagnetic unit of current in the centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system of units. It is equivalent to 10 amperes in the more commonly used International System of Units (SI).

  ## History&nbsp;
  The term "abampere" is derived from the CGS system, which bases its unit of current on electromagnetic definitions rather than mechanical ones.

  ## Conversions&nbsp;
  - To Ampere: 1 abampere = 10 amperes

  ## Practical Applications&nbsp;
  While not commonly used in daily applications, the abampere is still relevant in scientific studies involving electromagnetic calculations.
  `,
    ampere: `
  # Ampere&nbsp;
  
  The ampere is the base unit of electric current in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge, e, to be 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A·s.

  ## History&nbsp;
  Named after André-Marie Ampère, one of the main discoverers of electromagnetism, the ampere was originally defined as one coulomb per second.

  ## Conversions&nbsp;
  - Directly comparable to other units of current, such as the abampere.

  ## Practical Applications&nbsp;
  The ampere is crucial in all applications involving electrical systems, from household appliances to complex power grids.

    ampere_turn: `
  # Ampere Turn&nbsp;
  
  An ampere turn (amp-turn) is a unit of magnetomotive force, which is a quantity showing the ability of an electric current to induce a magnetic field in a coil.

  ## History&nbsp;
  The concept of ampere turns helps in understanding and designing electrical and electronic circuits involving coils and inductors.

  ## Conversions&nbsp;
  - Ampere turns are calculated by multiplying the current in amperes by the number of turns in a coil.

  ## Practical Applications&nbsp;
  Ampere turns are used to calculate the effectiveness of coils used in electrical devices like transformers, motors, and inductors.
