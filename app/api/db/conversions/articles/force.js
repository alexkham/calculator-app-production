    attonewton: `
  # Attonewton
  &nbsp;
  
  An attonewton is a unit of force in the metric system, equivalent to 10^-18 newtons.

  ## Notation
  &nbsp;
  
  The symbol for attonewton is aN.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Derived from the standard unit of force, the newton, it is used to measure extremely small forces in scientific research.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To newtons: 1 aN = 1 x 10^-18 N

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Typically used in particle physics and nanotechnology to measure and analyze forces at the atomic scale.
  `,
    centinewton: `
  # Centinewton
  &nbsp;
  
  A centinewton is one hundredth of a newton, a unit of force in the metric system.

  ## Notation
  &nbsp;
  
  The symbol for centinewton is cN.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  As a subdivision of the newton, it aids in measurements that require greater precision than the newton can provide.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To newtons: 1 cN = 0.01 N

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Used in engineering and physics when small forces need to be measured with high accuracy.
  `,
    decinewton: `
  # Decinewton
  &nbsp;
  
  A decinewton is one tenth of a newton, used to measure force.

  ## Notation
  &nbsp;
  
  The symbol for decinewton is dN.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Utilized to provide more granularity in force measurement than a newton, especially useful in fields requiring moderate precision.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To newtons: 1 dN = 0.1 N

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Commonly used in mechanical engineering and material science for testing and analysis.
  `,
    dekanewton: `
  # Dekanewton
  &nbsp;
  
  A dekanewton is equal to ten newtons. It is used to measure larger forces than typically measured by the newton alone.

  ## Notation
  &nbsp;
  
  The symbol for dekanewton is daN.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Provides a metric measurement that bridges smaller forces measured in newtons and larger forces measured in kilonewtons.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To newtons: 1 daN = 10 N

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Often used in construction and structural engineering where moderate to high forces are common.
  `,
    dyne: `
  # Dyne
  &nbsp;
  
  A dyne is a unit of force in the centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system, equivalent to 10^-5 newtons.

  ## Notation
  &nbsp;
  
  The symbol for dyne is dyn.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Used extensively in physics before the widespread adoption of the SI system, particularly in electromagnetism and fluid dynamics.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To newtons: 1 dyn = 1 x 10^-5 N

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Still used in certain scientific contexts, particularly in high-precision measurements of small forces.
