  # Celsius (°C)
  
  The Celsius scale, previously known as the centigrade scale, is a temperature scale used by the International System of Units (SI). As an SI derived unit, it is used worldwide. In the United States, Fahrenheit is used for most temperature measurements.
  
  ## History
  
  The scale was first introduced by Anders Celsius in 1742, initially reversing the scale present today. The Celsius scale was later reversed by Jean-Pierre Christin to its present form, where 0 degrees represents the freezing point of water, and 100 degrees represents the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Celsius is used worldwide, not only in weather forecasts and for medical purposes but also in many scientific applications.

    fahrenheit: `
  # Fahrenheit (°F)
  \n
  
  Fahrenheit is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit.
  
  ## History
  
  Daniel Fahrenheit originally used a scale that had a zero point determined by placing the thermometer in an equal mix of ice, water, and ammonium chloride (a salt). This gave him a fixed reference point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the freezing point of pure water.
  
  ## Usage
  
  In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is the primary temperature measurement system used in weather forecasting, the medical field, and many areas of industry.

    kelvin: `
  # Kelvin (K)
  
  Kelvin is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI) and is often used in conjunction with the Celsius scale. It is named after the Glasgow University engineer and physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin.
  
  ## History
  
  The Kelvin scale was first proposed by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1848. The scale is an absolute temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Kelvin is used extensively in the scientific community because of its linear relationship to other thermodynamic properties such as volume and pressure.
