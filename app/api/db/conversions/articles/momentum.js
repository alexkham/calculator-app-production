    gram_per_milliliter: `
  # Gram Per Milliliter
  &nbsp;
  
  Gram per milliliter is another common unit of density, often used in smaller scale or more precise laboratory measurements.

  ## Notation
  &nbsp;
  
  The symbol for gram per milliliter is g/mL.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Utilized for its ease of conversion to and from the metric system's base units.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To grams per liter: 1 g/mL = 1000 g/L

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Used in pharmacology, cooking, and any application requiring precise density measurements in small quantities.
