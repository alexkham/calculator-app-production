  # Degree
  &nbsp;
  
  A degree is a measurement of angle equal to 1/360 of a full revolution. Commonly used in navigation, geography, and many applied sciences.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  The division of the circle into 360 parts originated from ancient Babylonians who used a base 60 numbering system.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To radians: 1 degree = π/180 radians

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Used universally in many fields including astronomy, cartography, and engineering.
  `,
    gon: `
  # Gon
  &nbsp;
  
  Also known as a gradian, the gon is a unit of angle where one gon is defined as 1/400 of a full revolution.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Introduced as part of the metric system, and mainly used where base-10 divisions are preferred.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 gon = 0.9 degrees

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Commonly used in fields like surveying and civil engineering.
  `,
    mil: `
  # Mil
  &nbsp;
  
  A mil is a unit of angle used in military artillery to denote 1/6400 of a full revolution.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Originated from military practices for precision in artillery and targeting.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 mil ≈ 0.05625 degrees

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Predominantly used in military settings for ballistics and targeting calculations.
  `,
    minutes: `
  # Minutes
  &nbsp;
  
  An angle minute is 1/60 of a degree, also known as a minute of arc in geographical and astronomical measurements.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Derived from Babylonian astronomy, where each hour was divided into 60 minutes.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 minute = 1/60 degree

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Used in fields such as astronomy, optics, and precise measurements of geographic coordinates.
  `,
    octant: `
  # Octant
  &nbsp;
  
  An octant is equal to 1/8 of a full revolution, or 45 degrees.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Historically used in navigation, particularly with the octant navigational tool which measures angles up to 45 degrees.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 octant = 45 degrees

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Used in navigation and for angular measurements in early astronomical studies.
  `,
    quadrant: `
  # Quadrant
  &nbsp;
  
  A quadrant is equal to 1/4 of a full revolution, or 90 degrees.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  The concept is deeply rooted in both navigation and mathematics, particularly in trigonometry where angles are measured in quadrants.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 quadrant = 90 degrees

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Essential in navigation, astronomy, and many engineering fields.
  `,
    radian: `
  # Radian
  &nbsp;
  
  A radian is the angle created by taking the radius of a circle and wrapping it along the circle's edge. It is the standard unit of angular measure in mathematics and physics.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  The use of radians in mathematics was formalized by mathematicians in the 18th century.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 radian = 180/π degrees

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Used extensively in all fields of science and engineering that involve angular measurements or periodic phenomena.
  `,
    revolution: `
  # Revolution
  &nbsp;
  
  A revolution is a complete turn around a circle, equivalent to 360 degrees or 2π radians.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  The concept of measuring complete turns is fundamental in understanding rotational movements and cycles.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 revolution = 360 degrees

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Used to describe complete cycles in mechanics, electrical engineering, and other fields involving rotational dynamics.
  `,
    seconds: `
  # Seconds
  &nbsp;
  
  An angle second, also known as a second of arc, is 1/60 of an angle minute or 1/3600 of a degree.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Also derived from Babylonian astronomy for even more precise measurements than minutes.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 second = 1/3600 degree

  ## Practical Applications
  &nbsp;
  
  Critical in precise astronomical measurements, surveying, and navigation where fine detail is necessary.
  `,

  # Sextant
  &nbsp;
  
  A sextant is equal to 1/6 of a full revolution, or 60 degrees.

  ## History
  &nbsp;
  
  Named after the navigational instrument that utilizes this angular measurement to determine the altitude of celestial bodies.

  ## Conversions
  &nbsp;
  
  - To degrees: 1 sextant = 60 degrees

  ## Practical Applications
